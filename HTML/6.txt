Data and Web Mining


Instructor: Salvatore Orlando

Goals

Data Mining involves a set of techniques and methods to extract novel knowledge from large databases, to be profitably exploited by decisional processes. Data Mining is one of the main activities in the complex process of Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD). The course deals with the fundamentals of this subject, by focusing on the most important algorithmic techniques. 
Moreover, the course uses as case of study the Web, and the chances of extracting useful knowledge by mining the hyperlink structure of the Web, its contents and the usage logs.
